# BearWatch: Monitoring Impacts of Arctic Climate Change using Polar Bears, Genomics and Traditional Ecological Knowledge  


## A Genome Canada-supported project

&nbsp;  

![](assets/bearwatch_logo.jpg)

&nbsp;  

BearWatch seeks to create an alternate way to monitor polar bears across the Canadian Arctic using non-invasive genomics tools and Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit. BearWatch is a partnership among northern communities in Nunavut and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region, HTAs in Gjoa Haven and Coral Harbor, the Inuvialuit Game Council, the governments of Nunavut, Northwest Territories, and Yukon, the Canadian Rangers, and researchers and students at Queen's University, University of Toronto, University of Calgary, Trent University, McGill University, University of British Columbia, University of Northern British Columbia, and the Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique.
